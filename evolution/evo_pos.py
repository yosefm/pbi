"""
Evolutionary solution to the camera position. Based on camparing 3D points 
from converging rays to known positions. Spatial distances are weighted to 
favor low Ray Convergence Measure (RCM).

    """
    Checks the fitness of an evolutionary solution of calibration values to 
    target points. Fitness is the sum of squares of the distance from each 
    calculated point to the closest known point.
    
    To favor more correspondences while avoiding a solution between points, 
    pairs whose distance is more than the search radius are penalized.
    
    Arguments:
    solution - array, flattened rows for each camera. Each row concatenates: 
        position of intersection with Z=0 plane; 3 angles of exterior 
        calibration; primary point (xh,yh,cc); 3 radial distortion parameters; 
        2 decentering parameters.
    detections - a list of TargetArray objects, one per camera.
    glass_vecs - (c,3) array, one glass vector for each of c cameras. This is 
        the only part of the calibration struct that remains constant 
        throughout the iteration.
    known_points - (n,3) array, positions of known points seen by all cameras
        (may be composed by intersecting the per-camera lists) to compare 
        against.
    vpar - a VolumeParams object with observed volume size and criteria for 
        correspondence. Don't ask me why the forefathers put those in the same 
        place.
    cpar - a ControlParams object with image data.
    search_radius - acceptable distance between points to consider them a 
        valid pair.
    penalty - value added to fitness for each invalid pair.
