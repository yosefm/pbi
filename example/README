There are some examples here, here is how to run them.
The instructions refer to running from the source package. No install is 
needed, but if you did install, just change the necessary stuff to your 
install places.

The example directory is divided into data/ and config/, all paths in the 
config files are relative to example/, so you need to change directory to it.

Calibration
-----------

 $ cd example/
 $ python ../ui/cam_calib.py config/cal/cam1.yaml

For the evolutionary calibration:

 $ cd example/
 $ python ../evolution/evo_cal.py config/cal/cam1.yaml

Whenever you hit Ctrl-Z (probably Ctrl-D on windows?) you get the current 
status graphic, and current best solution printed to terminal.

Dumbbell marking:

 $ python ../ptv/dumbbell.py data/dumbbell/dumb%d.%04d /tmp/targs_%d. 0200 0281

Note that this tool has options to save and later reuse your clicks. Use the -h
option to learn more about it. To mark each rectangle, drag and release with 
the mouse. It doesn't matter if you mark right-left or the other way and the 
same goes to up-down. The coordinates are sorted after the click anyway.

Dumbbell correction to existing calibration:

  $ python ../ptv/dumbbell_correct.py config/dumbbell/dumbbell.yaml

Do this after running the marking as in the above example, or there won't be 
any target files.

Detection, correspondence, Epipolar lines
-----------------------------------------

 $ cd example/
 $ python ../ui/epi_checker.py config/cal/calib_check.yaml

Just because this example is in with the calibration doesn't limit you to use
it for other sets of images, like particle images from the experiment. But you
knew that, right?

Sequencing/Tracking
-------------------

Both of these use one file, config/seq_track.yaml
You have to prepare the directories that you list for output. In this example, you run:

 $ md seqtrack_res
 $ md seqtrack_targs

Then the sequencing is simple. This example uses large-particle detection by DoG.
Flags you don't understand, check with -h as always.
 
 $ python ../ptv/sequence.py config/seq_track.yaml -r -m dog
 $ python ../ptv/track.py config/seq_track.yaml 

That's it. Now you have your linkage.* files in seqtrack_res/

Note though that we use the example calibration and didn't try hard to make 
this data good, so the results may be a bit underwhelming.
