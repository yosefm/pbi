A Parallel-Runner process
-------------------------

The parallel_runner.py module supplies two classes:

1. the PoolWorker is a worker process that can receive commands like 'end',
   'wait', 'resume', and respond to them between jobs. The command are sent
    over a multiprocessing.Pipe object.

2. CLIController is a primitive shell that terminates when the workers end,
   and in the meantime collects results and can send commands to the
   PoolWorker.
